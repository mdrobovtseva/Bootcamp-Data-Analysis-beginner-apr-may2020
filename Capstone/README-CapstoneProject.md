## **Introduction**

For our Capstone project we decided to examine Happiness Scores of different countries throughout the years - from 2015 up to and including 2019. 
In the analysis we used the following datasets:

https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness - World Happiness Report, contains data for 2015-2019. Contains data on Happiness Score and the contribution of some socio-demographical features to the Happiness Score, e.g. how well GDP or Life Expectancy explain the Happiness Score for each country. 
This dataset consists of the following datafiles in this Git repository:

 
 -  2015.csv
 -  2016.csv
 -  2017.csv
 -  2018.csv
 -  2019.csv

https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world - Sociodemographic data of almost all countries from 2017, was used to answer one of the questios. In Git repository the dataset has the name "Demographic_data.csv".


### **Questions**
1. Are the Happiness Score and related indices associated? Does the association vary across years?
2. What are the happiest and least happy regions in the world? What is the region with the biggest difference between minimum and maximum happiness score?
3. Do happier countries also have higher GDP?
4. Which countries have more variation in happiness score between 2015 and 2019?
5. How Germany's and Brazil's results developed through years?
6. Which features make such a big difference between Austrialia and New Zealand and Sub-Saharan African?
